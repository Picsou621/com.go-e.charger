# Howto translate

These files are for translation of the application only and are not actively used.
When I receive a pull request I'll review them and then update the translation to the main files.
To edit the files fork this repository for your self and once you are done make a pull request for review and merging to the main repository.

## Application main information

app.json file contains the main information of the application.

- Verify `description` and `tags`.
- In the translators section add your name with the language flag.

```json
    "translators": [
      {
        "name": "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Tapio Heiskanen"
      },
      {
        "name": "ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± "
      },
      {
        "name": "ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª "
      },
      {
        "name": "ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· "
      }
    ]
